[Mission Control](https://alecmcgovern.github.io/mission-control/) is inspired by mystery adventure games like [Myst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst).  Players must discover and solve clues to unlock the story.

The game currently has only one task that users can complete, but more to come soon...

Built in an effort to better understand the way React and Redux work together.
