Hi,

If you're reading this, you're probably wondering what this project is.  Mission Control is inspired by mystery adventure games like [Myst](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myst).  Players must discover and solve clues to unlock the story.

The game is still in initial construction phase, so there is no "winning" yet.  There are, however, some clues scattered around already for you to find.  Good luck finding them!

Built in an effort to better understand the way React and Redux work together.
